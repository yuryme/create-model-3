# Excel Reports (Отчёт Excel)

An **Excel report** in BaSYS is a metaobject of kind `excel_report` that builds a report by filling a pre-designed `.xlsx` template with values produced by JavaScript data sources. The template carries the static layout (headers, merged cells, formatting, borders, fonts) and special markers (`{{...}}`, named ranges) that the server-side template engine (`ClosedXML.Report`) replaces with data at build time.

Documentation: https://basysteam.github.io/BaSys.Docs/ru/reporting/excelReport.html

## When to Use

Prefer Excel reports over [Data Views](data-view-reports.md) **only** when the user's request requires one of:

- **regulated reporting** — fixed government / industry forms where every cell is a separate calculation and the layout is strictly defined;
- **printable document forms** — invoices, waybills, acts, contracts, applications that must match an established sample exactly;
- **heavily-formatted summary reports** — multi-level headers, merged cells, custom page breaks, corporate branding that cannot be reproduced by a data-view indicator.

For typical tables, dashboards, charts, KPIs, pivots — use a `data_view` instead: building an `.xlsx` is significantly heavier (template parsing, formula evaluation, serialization), preview support is limited (single sheet, no charts/pivots/conditional formatting), and totals inserted by `<<sum>>`-style markup are not shown in the in-app preview.

## File Layout

- Kind `excel_report` has `StoreData = false` and `IsReference = false` → do **not** add an entry to `system/dataTypes.json`.
- Settings file location: `excel_report/{name}/excel_report.{name}.json` — must validate against `system/schemas/excelReportSettings.schema.json` (set `$schema` to the correct relative path).
- Top-level structure follows the standard metaobject conventions (`Uid`, `Name`, `Title`, `Memo`, `IsActive`, `Version`) plus two collections: `DataSources`, `Filters`.
- **Template** is stored as a **separate binary `.xlsx` file** in the same folder, named **strictly** `excel_report.{name}.template.xlsx` (this exact filename is what the import pipeline looks for). The template is **not** referenced from the JSON — the binding is by filename convention. Do **not** invent a custom name and do **not** embed the template content into the JSON.
- Data source scripts are stored as **separate `.bjs` files** in the same folder, named by the template `excel_report.{name}.data_source.{dataSourceName}.bjs` (e.g. `excel_report/sales_report/excel_report.sales_report.data_source.rows.bjs`).
- No `Header`, `DetailTables`, `Commands`, `Forms` or `RecordsSettings` — Excel reports store no user data and have no edit form.

### Working With the Template `.xlsx` File

`.xlsx` is a binary (zipped) format. The agent **must not** attempt to generate, modify or rewrite the template file programmatically — any such write will corrupt the workbook.

Rules for the agent:

- **Creating a new Excel report:** create only the `.json` settings file and the `.bjs` data source scripts. Tell the user that they need to prepare the `excel_report.{name}.template.xlsx` file themselves in Microsoft Excel (or a compatible editor) and place it in the metaobject's folder, and remind them of the marker syntax / named-range rules below. Do not create a placeholder `.xlsx`.
- **Editing an existing Excel report:** treat the existing `excel_report.{name}.template.xlsx` as opaque. You may rename data sources, filters and markers in the JSON / `.bjs` files only if you also instruct the user to update the matching markers / named ranges inside the template — keep the JSON-side names and the template-side markers in sync. Never edit the `.xlsx` file directly.
- The same rule applies to `.xlsb`, `.xls` and any other binary Excel formats — they are out of scope, the template **must** be `.xlsx`.

## Data Sources

Each entry of `DataSources` declares a named expression whose result is exposed to the template (and to subsequent data sources) under that name.

| Field        | Purpose                                                                                                |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Uid`        | Freshly generated UUID v4 for the data source.                                                         |
| `Name`       | Identifier (snake_case English). Becomes the key on `_data` and the marker name in the template.       |
| `Expression` | Filename of the companion `.bjs` script (e.g. `excel_report.sales_report.data_source.rows.bjs`).       |
| `Memo`       | Short description of what the source returns.                                                          |

Key rules:

- Sources are evaluated **strictly in declaration order**. Later sources may use earlier results via `_data.<earlierName>`. Order matters — put base queries first, derived aggregations afterwards.
- The `Expression` field must contain the **filename** of the `.bjs` script (not the script body). Create both the `DataSources` entry **and** the corresponding `.bjs` file. File naming: `excel_report.{objectName}.data_source.{dataSourceName}.bjs`.
- The script **must `return`** its result.
- Three implicit variables are available inside a data source script:
  - `_filters` — array of active filter values. Pass into the query builder via `.withFilters(_filters)`.
  - `_data` — dictionary of results of **earlier** data sources, addressable by their `Name` (e.g. `_data.rows`).
  - `_parameters` — dictionary of call parameters (rarely used).
- Prefer the BaSYS query builder (`from('kind.name').…query()`) over plain JS for DB access. See https://basysteam.github.io/BaSys.Docs/ru/calculations/queryBuilder.html.
- Use `.getDisplays()` when querying reference fields so that human-readable display values are available as `<column>_display` for use in template markers.
- Limit data volume with `.top(N)`, filters, aggregations — `.xlsx` generation is expensive.

### Supported Return Types

| Return type                       | Access in template                                | Notes                                                                                                                                                |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scalar (string, number, date, bool) | `{{sourceName}}`                                |                                                                                                                                                      |
| Object / dictionary / `Expando`   | `{{sourceName.property}}`                         | Server converts the dictionary into a typed CLR object on the fly (cached by signature). Dotted access works after conversion.                       |
| Collection of typed objects       | `{{item.Property}}` inside a named range          | The template must contain a **named range** whose name matches the data source `Name`. The engine repeats the range area per element.                |
| `DataTable`                       | `{{item["ColumnName"]}}` or `{{item[index]}}`     | Passed as `DataRowCollection`. Also requires a named range named after the source.                                                                   |

### Computing Totals

Totals should usually be computed **in a separate data source** that consumes the main source via `_data`, and then pulled into the template as plain markers. The `ClosedXML.Report` aggregate markup (`<<sum>>`, `<<count>>`, …) does produce Excel formulas, but their values are computed only when the file is opened in Excel — the in-app preview shows them as empty. Computing totals in a dedicated data source keeps them visible in the preview and reduces template engine work.

### Example

`excel_report/sales_report/excel_report.sales_report.json` (excerpt):

```json
"DataSources": [
  {
    "Uid": "3f5eb097-ca63-2414-4a5f-5ee0dc4e342e",
    "Name": "rows",
    "Expression": "excel_report.sales_report.data_source.rows.bjs",
    "Memo": "Строки отчёта — выгрузка движений по регистру с фильтрами формы."
  },
  {
    "Uid": "6179d17a-74ca-6a78-60c7-8d37eeb5a49f",
    "Name": "totals",
    "Expression": "excel_report.sales_report.data_source.totals.bjs",
    "Memo": "Итоговые суммы, рассчитанные поверх _data.rows."
  }
]
```

`excel_report.sales_report.data_source.rows.bjs`:

```javascript
var tableResult = await from('records.sales')
  .select(['period', 'contract as contract', 'amount as amount'])
  .getDisplays()
  .orderBy('period desc')
  .withFilters(_filters)
  .top(100)
  .query();

return tableResult;
```

`excel_report.sales_report.data_source.totals.bjs`:

```javascript
var amountTotal = _data.rows.sum('amount');
var result = {
  amount: amountTotal,
};

return result;
```

In the template, `rows` is a named range with cells like `{{item["contract_display"]}}` / `{{item["amount"]}}`, and totals are placed in regular cells as `{{totals.amount}}`.

## Filters

`Filters` configure the standard BaSYS filter bar / sidebar, integrated with the query builder. Each entry has the following fields:

| Field                       | Purpose                                                                                                                                  |
| :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Uid`                       | Freshly generated UUID v4.                                                                                                               |
| `Name`                      | Identifier used as the parameter name in queries (snake_case English; Cyrillic allowed only for filters that match a real Cyrillic column on the underlying source). |
| `Title`                     | Human-readable label shown in the UI.                                                                                                    |
| `DataPath`                  | Optional column path inside the source (usually `""`).                                                                                   |
| `DataTypeUid`               | UID from `system/dataTypes.json` describing the value type.                                                                              |
| `NumberDigits`              | Number of fractional digits for numeric filters (else `0`).                                                                              |
| `DefaultComparisonKind`     | Default operator: `0` Equal, `1` NotEqual, `2` Greater, `3` GreaterOrEqual, `4` Less, `5` LessOrEqual, `6` Between.                      |
| `RenderPlace`               | `0` Sidebar, `1` Header (above the command bar).                                                                                         |
| `ControlKindUid`            | UID of the input control (period picker, reference picker, date, number, etc.) — copy from a working filter of the same data type.      |
| `JoinOperator`              | `0` And, `1` Or — how the filter combines with neighbours.                                                                               |
| `Required`                  | If `true`, the report will not build until the user fills this filter.                                                                   |
| `AvailableComparisonKinds`  | Optional whitelist of operators offered in the UI (empty array = all kinds available).                                                   |

Active filter values are passed into every data source through the implicit `_filters` array and are applied to the query builder via `.withFilters(_filters)`. The query builder will look up each filter by its `Name` and apply the right column / operator pair, so the filter `Name` must match the column key produced by `select` (or by `getDisplays`).

For a deeper description of filter setup and the available control kinds see the BaSYS docs on configurable filters.

## Template Markers — Quick Reference

The agent does not write `.xlsx` files but must instruct the user on the marker syntax when designing or updating the template:

- **Scalar value:** `{{sourceName}}` (e.g. `{{period}}`).
- **Property of an object source:** `{{sourceName.property}}` (e.g. `{{totals.amount}}`).
- **Collection / DataTable:** place a **named range** in the workbook whose name equals the data source `Name`; inside the range use `{{item.Property}}` (typed collections) or `{{item["ColumnName"]}}` / `{{item[index]}}` (`DataTable`).
- **Keep named ranges tight.** Include only the cells that actually contain markers or styling — `ClosedXML.Report` processes every cell of the range when expanding the collection. Selecting whole rows "for spare" dramatically slows building.
- **Compute totals in data sources**, not via `<<sum>>` markup, when the totals need to appear in the in-app preview.
- See https://closedxml.io/ClosedXML.Report/docs/en/Markup.html for the full ClosedXML.Report markup language (nested ranges, grouping, sorting, conditional blocks, …).

## Building the Report — Quick Checklist

When the user asks to add a new Excel report:

1. Confirm `excel_report` is the right kind (vs `data_view`). If the requirement is a plain table / chart / dashboard, propose `data_view` first.
2. Create folder `excel_report/{name}/`.
3. Create `excel_report/{name}/excel_report.{name}.json` conforming to `excelReportSettings.schema.json`, with a fresh `Uid`, the chosen `Name` / `Title` / `Memo`, `IsActive = true`, `Version = 1`, and the `DataSources` / `Filters` collections filled in.
4. Create one `.bjs` file per data source, returning the value of the right shape (scalar / object / collection / `DataTable`).
5. Tell the user to prepare `excel_report.{name}.template.xlsx` themselves and to place it next to the JSON — describe which marker names and named ranges the template must contain (derived from `DataSources` names and the columns each source returns).
6. After the user uploads the template via import, the system will set `HasTemplate = true` automatically — the agent should not author that flag.

## General Hygiene

- Generate a fresh `Uid` (UUID v4, lowercase, hyphenated) for the metaobject and for every data source / filter.
- `Name` values must be in English, lowercase, `snake_case` and meaningful for new objects, columns and filters (existing Cyrillic names in the project must not be renamed).
- Fill `Memo` on the metaobject and on each data source / filter with a short Russian description of its purpose.
- Set `IsActive = true` unless the user explicitly asks to hide the report.
- Do not add an entry to `system/dataTypes.json` — kind `excel_report` is not a reference.

## Communication and Comments

- Communicate with the user in the language they use in chat (typically Russian).
- Code comments in `.bjs` data source scripts must follow the language already used in the file (typically Russian).
