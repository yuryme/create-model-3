# Print Forms (Печатные формы)

A **print form** in BaSYS is a per-instance document rendered for a specific metaobject record (by its primary key) by filling a pre-designed `.xlsx` template with values from data sources. The same template engine as for [Excel Reports](excel-reports.md) — `ClosedXML.Report` — is used; the difference is the binding and the trigger:

- a print form **belongs to a specific metaobject** (one metaobject can have several print forms);
- it is built **for a single object instance** identified by primary key;
- it is **not a separate metadata kind** — there is no `print_form/` folder at the repository root;
- it is invoked from the **Print** menu on the object's form, not from a navigation entry;
- there is **no in-app preview** — the file is downloaded immediately;
- **filters are not supported**.

Documentation: https://basysteam.github.io/BaSys.Docs/ru/reporting/printForms.html

## When to Use

Use a print form when the user needs:

- a printable document tied to a specific record — счета, накладные, акты, договоры, заявления, путевые листы;
- a printable card for a directory entry — карточка контрагента, карточка номенклатуры;
- any unified document that must be exported "as is" for one record without aggregation across a selection.

Compare with related kinds:

| Need                                                                  | Use                  |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------- |
| Printable document for a single record by its primary key             | **Print form**       |
| Self-standing report over a selection (regulated form, summary)       | [Excel Report](excel-reports.md) |
| Interactive table / chart / dashboard / KPI                           | [Data View](data-view-reports.md) |

If the same `.xlsx` layout must be available both as a printable doc on a record and as a standalone report — usually the print form is enough; do not duplicate it as an Excel report unless the user explicitly asks.

## Where Print Forms Are Allowed

Print forms can be created **only** for metaobjects whose kind has `UsePrintForms = true` (field on `MetaObjectKindSettings` in `system/kinds/kind.*.json`):

- by default this flag is **on** for `operation` (documents);
- for `catalog`, `register`, `enum` and other kinds it is **off**, but can be enabled in the kind's settings on the platform side.

Before creating a print form, check `system/kinds/kind.{kindName}.json` and confirm `UsePrintForms = true`. If it is `false`, tell the user the kind does not support print forms in the current model — do not silently create the file.

## File Layout

Print forms live **inside the owner metaobject's folder**, side by side with the metaobject JSON, commands and records sources. Each print form consists of three artefacts that share the same `formName` part of the filename:

| Artefact         | Filename                                                                            |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Settings JSON    | `{kind.Name}.{object.Name}.print_form.{formName}.json`                              |
| Template `.xlsx` | `{kind.Name}.{object.Name}.print_form.{formName}.template.xlsx`                     |
| Data source `.bjs` | `{kind.Name}.{object.Name}.print_form.{formName}.data_source.{dsName}.bjs` (one per source) |

Example for the `тарифы_дорожные` operation with a print form named `тарифы`:

```
operation/тарифы_дорожные/
├── operation.тарифы_дорожные.json                              ← metaobject
├── operation.тарифы_дорожные.print_form.тарифы.json            ← print form settings
├── operation.тарифы_дорожные.print_form.тарифы.template.xlsx   ← template
├── operation.тарифы_дорожные.print_form.источники.json
├── operation.тарифы_дорожные.print_form.источники.data_source.header.bjs
├── operation.тарифы_дорожные.print_form.источники.data_source.table_1.bjs
└── operation.тарифы_дорожные.print_form.источники.template.xlsx
```

Other rules:

- The print form settings JSON must validate against `system/schemas/printFormSettings.schema.json` (set `$schema` to the correct relative path, e.g. `"../../system/schemas/printFormSettings.schema.json"` for files two folders deep).
- `MetaObjectUid` in the print form **must** equal `Uid` of the owning metaobject — the system uses this to attach the print form to the correct object.
- Kind has nothing to do with `IsReference` here: the print form is **not** a metaobject of its own — do **not** add anything to `system/dataTypes.json`.
- The metaobject's main JSON does **not** reference its print forms — the binding is implicit, by `MetaObjectUid` inside each print form file.
- A single metaobject may have any number of print forms; their `Name` must be unique within the metaobject.
- Print forms are also **not** referenced from `Commands`, `Forms` or any other section of the metaobject JSON.

### Working With the Template `.xlsx` File

`.xlsx` is a binary (zipped) format. The agent **must not** attempt to generate, modify or rewrite the template file programmatically — any such write will corrupt the workbook.

Rules for the agent:

- **Creating a new print form:** create only the `.json` settings file and (if needed) the `.bjs` data source scripts. Tell the user that they need to prepare `{kind.Name}.{object.Name}.print_form.{formName}.template.xlsx` themselves in Microsoft Excel (or a compatible editor) and place it in the metaobject's folder, and remind them of the marker / named-range conventions below. Do not create a placeholder `.xlsx`.
- **Editing an existing print form:** treat the existing `*.template.xlsx` as opaque. You may rename data sources, fields or markers in the JSON / `.bjs` files only if you also instruct the user to update the matching markers / named ranges inside the template — keep the JSON-side names and the template-side markers in sync. Never edit the `.xlsx` file directly.
- The same rule applies to `.xlsb`, `.xls` and other binary Excel formats — they are out of scope, the template **must** be `.xlsx`.

## Settings Fields

The print form settings JSON has the following fields:

| Field              | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Uid`              | UUID v4 for the print form itself (freshly generated for new ones).                                                                                                                    |
| `MetaObjectUid`    | UID of the owner metaobject. Must match the `Uid` of the metaobject in `{kind.Name}/{object.Name}/{kind.Name}.{object.Name}.json`.                                                     |
| `TemplateKind`     | Template kind. Currently the only supported value is `0` (Excel).                                                                                                                      |
| `Name`             | System name (snake_case English; for new forms — meaningful and ≤30 chars). Must be unique within the metaobject.                                                                      |
| `Title`            | UI label shown in the **Print** menu on the object's form.                                                                                                                             |
| `Memo`             | Short Russian description of what the print form is for.                                                                                                                               |
| `TextTemplate`     | Reserved for future text-based template kinds. For Excel-based print forms keep it empty (`""`).                                                                                       |
| `IsActive`         | If `false`, the print form is hidden from the Print menu (settings and template stay in DB). Default `true`.                                                                           |
| `AutoRetrieveData` | If `true`, the server automatically reads the object's header and all detail tables and exposes them in the template — see "Auto-Retrieved Data" below.                                |
| `Version`          | System-managed numeric version. Set to `1` for new print forms; the server increments it on save.                                                                                      |
| `DataSources`      | Ordered array of named data sources (see below). May be empty when `AutoRetrieveData = true` is enough.                                                                                |

`HasTemplateFile` is a server-computed flag and must **not** be authored manually.

### Choosing `AutoRetrieveData`

- **Default: `AutoRetrieveData = true`.** For a typical document print form (single record, header + a couple of detail tables) it is the simplest setup — no data sources are needed at all.
- Use `AutoRetrieveData = false` only if the form needs none of the standard object data (e.g. a notification / reminder built entirely from related queries). Even then it is usually easier to leave it on and ignore the auto-loaded names in the template.
- The flag does **not** prevent you from adding custom data sources alongside auto-loaded data; it only controls whether `header` / detail tables are placed into the context for free.

## Auto-Retrieved Data (`AutoRetrieveData = true`)

When the flag is on, the server reads the current object by primary key and places the data into the template context under fixed names:

| Name in template            | Content                                                                                                                                       |
| :-------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `header`                    | Object header (`Header`) with display values resolved for reference fields. Accessed in the template as `{{header.<columnName>}}`.            |
| `<detailTableName>`         | Each detail table from the metaobject is passed as a `DataTable` under its own `Name`. Accessed via `{{item["<columnName>"]}}` in a same-named named range. |

Display values for reference columns are resolved automatically; you do **not** need to query referenced catalogs separately to print the human-readable representation.

### Markers — Header

The header is a single object, accessed with dot notation:

```
{{header.number}}
{{header.date}}
{{header.contractor}}
```

For reference fields (e.g. `contractor`) the engine substitutes the resolved display value, not the bare UID.

### Markers — Detail Tables

Each detail table is exposed as a `DataTable` under its `Name` (the table's own `Name`, not its `Title`). The template must contain an Excel **named range** with that exact name; inside the range cells use `{{item["<columnName>"]}}`:

```
{{item["nomenclature"]}}
{{item["quantity"]}}
{{item["sum"]}}
```

The engine repeats the named-range area once per row of the detail table.

## Data Sources

When auto-retrieved data is not enough — pulling extra fields from related catalogs, computing totals, querying arbitrary tables — declare custom data sources in `DataSources`.

| Field        | Purpose                                                                                                |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Uid`        | Freshly generated UUID v4 for the data source.                                                         |
| `Name`       | Identifier (snake_case English). Becomes the key on `_data` and the marker name in the template.       |
| `Expression` | Filename of the companion `.bjs` script (e.g. `operation.invoice.print_form.invoice.data_source.contractor_details.bjs`). |
| `Memo`       | Short Russian description of what the source returns.                                                  |

Key rules:

- Sources are evaluated **strictly in declaration order**. Later sources may use earlier results via `_data.<earlierName>`. Order matters — put base queries first, derived aggregations afterwards.
- The `Expression` field must contain the **filename** of the `.bjs` script (not the script body). Create both the `DataSources` entry **and** the corresponding `.bjs` file. File naming: `{kind.Name}.{object.Name}.print_form.{formName}.data_source.{dsName}.bjs`.
- The script **must `return`** its result.
- Choose data source `Name`s that do not collide with auto-retrieved names (`header`, names of detail tables) unless you intentionally want to **override** them — declaring a data source with the same name as an auto-retrieved value replaces it in the context.
- Prefer the BaSYS query builder (`from('kind.name').…query()`) over plain JS for DB access. See https://basysteam.github.io/BaSys.Docs/ru/calculations/queryBuilder.html.
- Use `.getDisplays()` when querying reference fields so that human-readable display values are available as `<column>_display` for use in template markers.
- Print forms render **one record** — keep queries narrow. Filter by the current object's primary key (`_parameters.object_uid` or `_parameters.<pkName>`) instead of pulling whole tables.

### Reserved Variables in Data Source Scripts

| Name           | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_parameters`  | Dictionary of call parameters automatically populated by the server: `kind_name`, `object_name`, `object_uid` (the PK value in the PK column's type), and the same value under the PK system name (e.g. `id`, `number`, `code`). |
| `_data`        | Dictionary of values already in the context: results of earlier data sources, plus `header` and detail tables when `AutoRetrieveData = true`.                                                                                    |
| `_filters`     | Always an empty collection for print forms (provided only for compatibility with the expression library — print forms have no configurable filters).                                                                             |

### Example: pull related data for a single record

For the operation `реализация_товаров`, a print form `накладная` with `AutoRetrieveData = true` already exposes `header` and the detail table `товары`. To add the contractor's INN / address (not present in the document header), declare a data source:

```json
"DataSources": [
  {
    "Uid": "3f5eb097-ca63-2414-4a5f-5ee0dc4e342e",
    "Name": "contractor_details",
    "Expression": "operation.реализация_товаров.print_form.накладная.data_source.contractor_details.bjs",
    "Memo": "Реквизиты контрагента документа: ИНН, КПП, адрес, телефон."
  }
]
```

`operation.реализация_товаров.print_form.накладная.data_source.contractor_details.bjs`:

```javascript
var contractorUid = _data.header.contractor;

var rows = await from('catalog.контрагенты')
  .select(['inn', 'kpp', 'address', 'phone'])
  .where('uid = @uid')
  .parameter('uid', contractorUid)
  .query();

return rows.first();
```

In the template the contractor reads as `{{contractor_details.inn}}`, `{{contractor_details.address}}`, etc.

### Example: pull header by primary key without auto-retrieve

When `AutoRetrieveData = false`, fetch the header explicitly using the parameters provided by the server:

```javascript
var headerTable = await from('operation.тарифы_дорожные')
  .getDisplays()
  .where('number = @number')
  .parameter('number', _parameters.object_uid)
  .query();

return headerTable.rows[0];
```

Naming the source `header` lets the template keep using `{{header.number}}` / `{{header.date}}` etc.

### Supported Return Types

Same as Excel reports — see the [excel-reports rule](excel-reports.md) for the full table. Quick recap:

| Return type                       | Access in template                                | Notes                                                                                                  |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Scalar (string, number, date)     | `{{sourceName}}`                                  |                                                                                                        |
| Object / dictionary / `Expando`   | `{{sourceName.property}}`                         | Server converts the dictionary to a typed CLR object on the fly (cached by signature).                 |
| Collection of typed objects       | `{{item.Property}}` inside a same-named named range | Template must contain a named range whose name matches the data source `Name`.                         |
| `DataTable`                       | `{{item["ColumnName"]}}` or `{{item[index]}}` inside a same-named named range | Same as above; column access is by string key or numeric index.                       |

## Template Markers — Quick Reference

The agent does not write `.xlsx` files but must instruct the user on the marker syntax when designing or updating the template:

- **Header field (auto-retrieved):** `{{header.<columnName>}}` — display values are already resolved for reference columns.
- **Detail table (auto-retrieved):** named range with the table's `Name`; cells like `{{item["<columnName>"]}}`.
- **Custom scalar source:** `{{sourceName}}`.
- **Custom object source:** `{{sourceName.property}}`.
- **Custom collection / DataTable source:** named range with the source `Name`; `{{item.Property}}` (typed collections) or `{{item["ColumnName"]}}` / `{{item[index]}}` (`DataTable`).
- **Keep named ranges tight.** Include only the cells that actually contain markers or styling — `ClosedXML.Report` processes every cell of the range when expanding the collection. Selecting whole rows "for spare" dramatically slows building.
- **Totals.** `<<sum>>`, `<<count>>` and similar `ClosedXML.Report` aggregate markup are converted to ordinary Excel formulas. Print forms have no in-app preview, so the formulas recompute when the user opens the file in Excel and the limitation that totals are not shown in preview is irrelevant. **However**, if the file may be opened in viewers that do not recompute formulas (mail-client previews, mobile viewers), compute totals in a dedicated data source and place them in the template as plain markers.
- See https://closedxml.io/ClosedXML.Report/docs/en/Markup.html for the full ClosedXML.Report markup language (nested ranges, grouping, sorting, conditional blocks, …).

## How the Print Command Appears

When the metaobject's kind has `UsePrintForms = true` and the object has at least one active print form with an uploaded template, the **Print** button appears on the object's form. Its drop-down lists the `Title`s of every active print form. Selecting a print form posts to:

```
POST /api/dataObjects/print/{kind}/{name}/{uid}
{ "formName": "<print form Name>", ... }
```

The server builds the `.xlsx`, places it in a temporary file cache and returns a file id; the client downloads the file under the server-supplied filename. There is **no preview** — the file is saved straight to disk.

To hide a print form temporarily without deleting its settings or template, set `IsActive = false`.

## Building a Print Form — Quick Checklist

When the user asks to add a new print form:

1. **Identify the owner metaobject** and its folder.
2. **Verify** that `system/kinds/kind.{kindName}.json` has `UsePrintForms = true`. If not, tell the user the kind does not support print forms and stop.
3. **Pick a `formName`** in English `snake_case` (e.g. `invoice`, `act`, `contractor_card`). Must be unique among print forms of this metaobject.
4. **Create the settings file** `{kind.Name}/{object.Name}/{kind.Name}.{object.Name}.print_form.{formName}.json` with:
   - `$schema` pointing to `system/schemas/printFormSettings.schema.json`;
   - a fresh `Uid`;
   - `MetaObjectUid` equal to the metaobject's `Uid`;
   - `TemplateKind = 0`, `TextTemplate = ""`;
   - `Name`, `Title`, `Memo`, `IsActive = true`, `Version = 1`;
   - `AutoRetrieveData = true` (default) or `false` if the user explicitly asks;
   - `DataSources = []` for the simple case, or filled with custom sources.
5. **For each data source**, create the `.bjs` file `{kind.Name}.{object.Name}.print_form.{formName}.data_source.{dsName}.bjs` next to the JSON, with a `return` and using `_parameters` / `_data` as needed.
6. **Tell the user to prepare** `{kind.Name}.{object.Name}.print_form.{formName}.template.xlsx` themselves in Excel and place it in the same folder. Describe which markers and named ranges the template must contain (derived from `header` + detail-table names when `AutoRetrieveData = true`, plus the names of any custom data sources).
7. **Do not** edit `system/dataTypes.json` — print forms are not a reference type.

## General Hygiene

- Generate a fresh `Uid` (UUID v4, lowercase, hyphenated) for the print form and for every data source.
- `Name` values must be in English, lowercase, `snake_case` and meaningful for new print forms and data sources (existing Cyrillic names already in the project must not be renamed).
- Fill `Memo` on the print form and on each data source with a short Russian description of its purpose.
- Set `IsActive = true` unless the user explicitly asks to hide the print form.
- The filename of every `.bjs` file must match the value of `Expression` in the JSON exactly.
- The `.xlsx` template's filename is mandatory: `{kind.Name}.{object.Name}.print_form.{formName}.template.xlsx`.
- Do not introduce third-party npm dependencies — the runtime is provided by the platform.

## Communication and Comments

- Communicate with the user in the language they use in chat (typically Russian).
- Code comments in `.bjs` data source scripts must follow the language already used in the file (typically Russian).
